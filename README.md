<p style="text-align: center;">A rewrite to a game which I am legally disallowed to reference. There can be no association between <b>TauBetaDelta</b> and its progenitor.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This is a <b>Work In Progress</b>.</i></p>   
  
I welcome anyone who wants to join and work on this. *If you do*, I have to let you know that there will be an agreement to not mention or reference the original from which this work is derived. And I think it's terrible we can't openly and publically pay homage to the original work. ***TBD*** will remain an open-source work. This is (intended to be) a mod-capable game.

So ... there is a lot to be done. I'm working on issues and the project roadmap. That is a lot of work in and of itself.
